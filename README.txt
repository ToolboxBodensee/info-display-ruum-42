info-beamer for the Raspberry PI
--------------------------------

info-beamer allows you to develop interactive visualizations
using the Lua programming language. Read more about it on the main
website: https://info-beamer.com/pi/

The complete documentation for info-beamer is available on
https://info-beamer.com/doc/info-beamer

Be sure to read the (very short) license in LICENSE.txt

This release of info-beamer for the Raspberry PI is tested on
Raspbian "Wheezy" (hardfloat) and Raspbian "Jessie" (hardfloat).
Images for Raspbian are available on

    http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads

Raspbian is also available as part of the NOOBS installer. Learn
more about it on http://www.raspberrypi.org/help/noobs-setup/




Installation
------------

Installing info-beamer depends on which Raspbian version you're
using. You can find out your Raspbian version by typing

    cat /etc/debian_version

If the command returns '8.0' you're using Raspbian jessie. If
it returns '7.0' you're still using the older version Wheezy.
Make sure you did download the correct version of info-beamer on:

    https://info-beamer.com/download/player

You have to install different dependencies depending on which
Raspbian you're using. Please have a look at the next two
section of this Readme to find out how to proceed depending
on your version.

Regardless of the version you're using, it is strongly
recommended to increase the memory available to the GPU.
Edit /boot/config.txt and increase gpu_mem. A minimum
of 192MB is recommended. If you don't provide enough GPU memory
image and video loading won't work!

If there is no gpu_mem line in /boot/config.txt, just add
the line

    gpu_mem=192

at the end of the file.

Make sure you have a power supply that provides enough power
to your PI. If you don't provide at least 2000mA things might
become unstable.

Be sure to update to the latest Raspberry PI firmware using
the command

   apt-get update
   apt-get install raspberrypi-kernel




Installation on Raspbian Jessie
-------------------------------

You can install all required dependencies by running the
following commands:

   apt-get update
   apt-get install libevent-2.0-5 libavformat56 \
                   libpng12-0 libfreetype6 libavresample2




Installation on Raspbian Wheezy
-------------------------------

Make sure the newest kernel is active by rebooting your PI. Then
install the required dependencies:

   apt-get update
   apt-get install libevent-2.0-5 libavformat53 \
                   libpng12-0 libfreetype6 libavresample1




Usage
-----

That's all. info-beamer should work. You don't need a running
X server. Just start info-beamer from the command line.

To run any of the included examples, you can try these commands:

    ./info-beamer samples/hello

To stop info-beamer use Ctrl-C or press Escape.

If you want to use info-beamer commercially be sure to buy a
license. Your support keeps the software alive. Thanks!

If you want a fully hosted version of info-beamer where you can
control everything from a website, consider info-beamer hosted.
Besides letting you run all code you've written reliably on many
devices there are lots of other benefits. You can learn more

Notes about the PI version
--------------------------

 * There are some additional tools that might be useful to
   you when developing/deploying info-beamer on the PI. See
   https://github.com/info-beamer/tools

 * Background loading uses a fixed set of worker threads.
   The default number is 6. This is enough to load/play 6
   resources at once. If the limit is hit, loading another
   resource will block until one of the threads is available
   again. If you ever need more that 6 worker threads you
   can use INFOBEAMER_THREAD_POOL to specify the number
   of threads available for resource loading/playing:

   export INFOBEAMER_THREAD_POOL=12

 * Audio destination for the output can be controlled by

   export INFOBEAMER_AUDIO_TARGET=hdmi

   for output to HDMI (see also "Known bugs" below) or

   export INFOBEAMER_AUDIO_TARGET=local

   for output using the analog mini phone jack.

 * Hardware watchdog support. You can use the hardware watchdog
   support on the PI to automatically hard reboot the PI should
   info-beamer become stuck for X seconds. The recommended
   number for X is 5 seconds. To enable the watchdog, load
   the kernel module and set the following environment variable:

   modprobe bcm2708_wdog
   export INFOBEAMER_WATCHDOG=5

   You probably need root access to open the /dev/watchdog
   device file.

You can see all available options if you run 'info-beamer -h'.




Known bugs
----------

HDMI audio and paused videos:

    If you enable HDMI audio output and load a video with audio
    track in paused mode, all other running videos that use audio
    output might pause due to a firmware bug in the raspberry pi.
    You can read more about this on the github page here:

    https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/issues/547

    As this problem is due to a bug in the Pi firmware and not in
    info-beamer itself, there is literally nothing I can do to
    fix this reliably other than begging in the github issue tracker.

GPIO 1, 23, 24, 26 and 'local' audio:

    It seems that once you set `gpio mode 1 pwm`, info-beamer
    can no longer play audio to the 'local' target. If you use
    'hdmi' instead everything works fine. There is a firmware
    issue about this here:

    https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/issues/741

Other than that, there are no known bugs. Please get in contact
if you find any problem.
